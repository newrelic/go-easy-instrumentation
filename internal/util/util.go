// util is a package that contains common utility functions used across the application.
// This is a convenient place to put any function that interacts with the `types` or `ast` packages
// from the Go standard library. This package is also a good place to put any functions that are
// used in multiple places, and especially in multiple packages. This package should be kept as
// small as possible, and should not contain any functions that are specific to a single package.
// All exported functions must be documented in a way that is compatible with `godoc`.
