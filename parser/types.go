// StatefulTracingFunctions are functions that require knowledge of the current tracing state of the package to apply instrumentation.
// These functions are passed the current tracing state of the package, and return a boolean indicating whether the function was modified.
// If the function was modified, it is likely that a transaction is required.
// The tracingName parameter is used to identify the object containing a New Relic Transaction.
// These functions are invoked on every statement in the body of a function that is being traced by the TraceFunction function.

// StatelessTracingFunction is a function that does not need to be aware of the current tracing state of the package to apply instrumentation.
// These functions are passed the current node, the InstrumentationManager, and a cursor to the current node.
// These functions are invoked on every node in the DST tree no matter what.

// DependencyScan is a function that scans a function declaration for dependencies that need to be recognized before tracing occurs.
// Functions that implement this should be designed to detect a specific thing during a walk of the full AST tree of an application.
